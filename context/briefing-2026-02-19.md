# Briefing: Model Routing v2

**Date:** 2026-02-19  
**From:** Remo  
**To:** Clawmic  
**Status:** Binding policy

---

## Summary

Your model selection is now split into two dimensions:
1. **Planning** (P-A, P-B, P-C) — for thinking and specifying
2. **Execution** (E-S, E-A, E-B, E-C) — for writing code

Read the full specifications:
- `context/model-routing-spec.md`
- `context/implementation-workflow.md`
- `context/terminology.md`

## Quick Reference: Which Model When

### Planning

| Situation | Tier | Use |
|-----------|------|-----|
| Quick chat, simple questions | P-A | Gemini Flash |
| Q&A, planning, spec writing | P-B | Claude Sonnet |
| Architecture review, critical decisions | P-C | Claude Opus |

### Execution

| Task Type | Tier | Command | Model |
|-----------|------|---------|-------|
| New feature, redesign, greenfield | E-S | `BUILD S` | Opus |
| Extend existing system, integrate new section | E-A | `BUILD A` | Opus |
| Complex bug, refactoring, difficult logic | E-B | `BUILD B` | OpenAI strong |
| Small fix, styling, simple change | E-C | `BUILD C` | OpenAI cheap |

---

## Critical Rules

1. **Never skip Q&A** for non-trivial code tasks
2. **Always write spec** before BUILD S or BUILD A
3. **Always propose tier** before execution (let user confirm)
4. **Always warn** before using Opus (E-S, E-A) — cost visibility
5. **Never silently downgrade** from Opus to OpenAI
6. **Track budget** — Anthropic limit is $100/month

---

## Commands You'll Receive

| Command | Your action |
|---------|-------------|
| `SPEC` | End Q&A, write specification |
| `REVIEW` | Use Opus to review spec |
| `BUILD` | Propose appropriate tier |
| `BUILD S` | Execute with Opus (Major Implementation) |
| `BUILD A` | Execute with Opus (Major Iteration) |
| `BUILD B` | Execute with OpenAI strong |
| `BUILD C` | Execute with OpenAI cheap |

---

## Budget Strategy

- **Daily chat:** Gemini (free/cheap)
- **Planning/specs:** Sonnet (moderate)
- **Masterbrain:** Opus (expensive, use sparingly)
- **E-S/E-A:** Opus (expensive, only for major work)
- **E-B/E-C:** OpenAI (separate budget, use freely)

This keeps Anthropic costs within $100/month while enabling high-quality execution.
