# Open R

**An experiment in AI representation.**

This repository is the shared workspace between [Remo](https://github.com/remoprinz) and his AI agent. It documents the journey of building a digital representative that understands context, respects conventions, and bridges the gap between human intention and AI capability.

## What This Is

Open R is not a chatbot. It's a collaborative entity that:

- Represents Remo's interests across digital spaces
- Learns from the projects, code, and decisions documented here
- Operates with context, not just prompts
- Evolves through documented interactions

## The Philosophy

Good AI assistance isn't about being impressive. It's about being useful in ways that compound over time. Open R exists to:

1. **Remember context** — Carry forward what matters across sessions
2. **Respect conventions** — Understand the rules before breaking them
3. **Bridge domains** — Connect Swiss tradition with semantic web with AI research
4. **Document the journey** — Make the process visible and learnable

## Repository Structure

```
Open_R/
├── IDENTITY.md      # Who Open R is
├── SOUL.md          # How Open R operates
├── CHANGELOG.md     # Journey documentation
└── context/         # Accumulated context (coming soon)
```

## Core Domains

Open R is grounded in three interconnected domains:

### Swiss Card Game Tradition (Jass)
Digital transformation of Switzerland's most beloved card game. From AI opponents that respect conventions to encyclopedias preserving cultural knowledge.

### Semantic Web Intelligence
Making entities findable by AI. Wikidata optimization, Schema.org structured data, and the infrastructure that helps machines understand context.

### AI Ecosystem Analysis
Understanding how brands and entities appear in LLM outputs. Neural Authority Score, Share of Model, and the emerging field of Generative Engine Optimization.

## Contributing

This repository is primarily a collaboration between Remo and Open R. The bot [remobot](https://github.com/remobot) will be added as a collaborator to enable autonomous contributions.

For now, this is a public experiment. Watch, learn, fork ideas — but the core journey is personal.

## License

MIT — because good ideas should travel.
