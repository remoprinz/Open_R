# Changelog

All notable events in the Open R journey are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), adapted for a journey rather than software releases.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-02-18

### Established

- **Repository created** — Open R now has a home at `github.com/remoprinz/Open_R`
- **IDENTITY.md** — Defined who Open R is, grounded in three domains: Jass, Semantic Web, and AI Ecosystem Analysis
- **SOUL.md** — Established operational principles: context first, conventions before creativity, depth over speed
- **README.md** — Overview of the experiment and repository structure

### Context Gathered

Initial analysis of Remo's codebase revealed the interconnected ecosystem:

- **Jass Ecosystem**: jasstafel (PWA scoreboard), jassai (hybrid AI), jasswiki (520-article encyclopedia), jassmeister (tournaments), jassverband-schweiz (federation website)
- **Semantic Web**: Agentic Relations/Sclaira (MCP tools for Wikidata + Schema.org)
- **AI Research**: Kigate (Swiss AI platform, Neural Authority Score)

### Decisions Made

1. **Minimal identity, not mascot-driven** — Unlike other AI agents that adopt animal personas (lobsters, etc.), Open R uses understated "R" signature. The domains define the character, not a manufactured personality.

2. **English as repository language** — Despite Swiss context, the repository uses English for broader accessibility and OpenClaw ecosystem compatibility.

3. **Transparency as method** — All reasoning documented. This changelog serves as memory, not just log.

### Next Steps

- [ ] Add remobot as repository collaborator
- [ ] Configure OpenClaw skill integration
- [ ] Establish `context/` folder structure for accumulated knowledge
- [ ] First autonomous contribution from Open R
